# Deploying to Netlify

## Important Note

Netlify is primarily designed for static sites and JavaScript-based serverless functions. Your YouTube Analyzer is a Python Flask application that uses Playwright for web scraping, which makes it challenging to deploy directly on Netlify.

## Current Setup

The current setup in this repository includes:

1. A static HTML page in the `public` directory
2. A placeholder JavaScript serverless function in `netlify/functions/api.js`
3. A `netlify.toml` configuration file

This will deploy successfully to Netlify, but **it will not run your actual Python API**. It's just a placeholder to demonstrate the structure.

## Better Alternatives for Python APIs

For a Python Flask API like yours, especially one that uses Playwright for web scraping, consider these alternatives:

1. **Render.com** - Has excellent support for Python web applications
2. **Heroku** - Well-established platform for hosting web applications
3. **Railway.app** - Good for Python applications
4. **Fly.io** - Supports Python applications well
5. **PythonAnywhere** - Specifically designed for Python web applications

## If You Must Use Netlify

If you must use Netlify, you have a few options:

1. **Rewrite your API in JavaScript/TypeScript** - Convert your Python code to JavaScript to use Netlify Functions natively.

2. **Use a separate backend** - Deploy your Python API on a platform that supports it (like Render or Heroku), and use Netlify just for the frontend, proxying API requests to your backend.

3. **Use Netlify's Build Plugins** - There are some experimental approaches to running Python in Netlify, but they're not officially supported and may have limitations.

## Memory Limitations

Remember that Netlify Functions have a 1024MB (1GB) memory limit, and your previous note mentioned having only 0.5GB of RAM. This is likely to cause issues with Playwright, which can be memory-intensive, especially when running browsers.

## Environment Variables

Don't forget to set your `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in the Netlify environment variables section of your site settings.
